# SOLUTIONS TO LEETCODE PROBLEMS 

none of these solutions are optimised at all 
they contain a very simple, straight forward 
solution

## interesting to optimise

> nr 33  (bad algorithm)  
> nr 56  
> nr 138 (algorithm is O(3n), easily optimisable to O(2n))  
> nr 239 (mem good but speed bad)  
> nr 403
